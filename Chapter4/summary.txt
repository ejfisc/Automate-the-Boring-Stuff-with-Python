Chapter 4 went over lists, other sequence data types, and references. I think the stuff about tuples and 
strings is unique to python, so that was pretty interesting. Lists do have some cool rules and methods. 
The references stuff made perfect sense. Conway's game of life was pretty interesting to learn about
and recreate.

Chapter 3 went over some new keywords, variable scope, the python callstack (works very similar to
any other callstack) and exception handling. Again, all stuff I'm very familiar with, just exploring
syntax and semantics of the language. 

I'm really liking python so far actually, it is very easy to understand and work with, 
and a lot of these rules make sense. They are a bit weird coming from mostly Java, but I like them.

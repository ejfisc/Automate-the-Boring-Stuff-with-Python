# overview of the math operators in python in order of operations

# exponent operator: **
print(2 ** 3) # evaluates to 8

# modulus/remainder operator: %
print(22 % 8) # evaluates to 6

# integer division/floored quotient operator: //
print(22 // 8) # evaluates to 2

# division operator: /
print(22 / 8) # evaluates to 2.75

# multiplication operator: * 
print(3 * 5) # evaluates to 15

# subtraction operator: -
print(5 - 2) # evaluates to 3

# addition operator: +
print(2 + 2) # evaluates to 4

# order of operations example:
print((5-1) * ((7+1) / (3-1))) # evaluates to 16.0
